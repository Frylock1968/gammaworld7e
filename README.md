This is very much a beta version, so please let me know if you spot any errors or have other features you'd like to see. I'll never do a true campaign manager for it, but little tools like the ones I created (i.e., encounter creation) are doable. On the front page of the application, I have a "release notes" button you can press to get more information. My code isn't the most efficient from a programming perspective because I'm relearning the art. However, structurally inefficient code sometimes makes for faster code (in a narrow set of instances), and because this game is structurally quite simple, that works here.
This is an MS Access database, which means two things. First, the tool is limited in a bunch of ways that affect even simple projects like this one. The user interface leaves something to be desired, though I think the chracter sheet somehow came out pretty well. Second, this won't work on Apple products without some workarounds I don't completely understand. You're on your own on that one.
I plan to replace this with a web-based product, but that's a little ways off.
I'm also in the process of creating a character builder for the FASA Star Trek RPG from the 1980s. It can currently create Federation and Romulan PCs, so I still need to add the capacity to create Klingon and Orion PCs. However, in 2012, I created an application that did everything else. It allows you to instantly create solar systems, NPCs of all races, starships MCPs, etc. You can find those materials here: https://gsllcblog.com/fasa-star-trek-rpg-resources/. All are free, though I do have a donation button somewhere on that blog (hint, hint).

EDIT 1/13/2026: I added a very primitive, and thus clunky, initiative tracker to the GM Tools screen. I'll probably try to clean it up at a later date, but the way it works is as follows: On tab 1 of GM Tools, enter in all your PCs, which includes character and player names, hit points, initiative bonus, and initiative score (rolled or assigned). On tab 2, build your NPC encounter (as already exists) then click the Initiative button. Nothing will appear to happen, but when you go to the next tab, you'll see all PCs and NPCs in an initiative tracker. You can add conditions and modify their hit points, but you have to go back to the encounter builder to once again pull up an NPC's stat block. You can delay characters or break initiative ties by moving them up or down in order. You can track their hit points and conditions. Note: Data is persistent. If you close out the software, your encounter data will still be there when you get back. Warning: Hitting the Initiative button undoes your current initiative, rerolling your scores. Future plans: I plan to give you the ability to quickly pull up the definition of a condition and pull up stat blocks from the initiative page. I also plan to allow you to import existing characters rather than have to type them in. This is not a priority, as there's very little data that you currently need to enter, but allowing you to do so would give me the availability of data for the GM to open a PC stat block as well.
