This is very much a beta version, so please let me know if you spot any errors or have other features you'd like to see. I'll never do a true campaign manager for it, but little tools like the ones I created (i.e., encounter creation) are doable. On the front page of the application, I have a "release notes" button you can press to get more information. My code isn't the most efficient from a programming perspective because I'm relearning the art. However, structurally inefficient code sometimes makes for faster code (in a narrow set of instances), and because this game is structurally quite simple, that works here.
This is an MS Access database, which means two things. First, the tool is limited in a bunch of ways that affect even simple projects like this one. The user interface leaves something to be desired, though I think the chracter sheet somehow came out pretty well. Second, this won't work on Apple products without some workarounds I don't completely understand. You're on your own on that one.
I plan to replace this with a web-based product, but that's a little ways off.
I'm also in the process of creating a character builder for the FASA Star Trek RPG from the 1980s. It can currently create Federation and Romulan PCs, so I still need to add the capacity to create Klingon and Orion PCs. However, in 2012, I created an application that did everything else. It allows you to instantly create solar systems, NPCs of all races, starships MCPs, etc. You can find those materials here: https://gsllcblog.com/fasa-star-trek-rpg-resources/. All are free, though I do have a donation button somewhere on that blog (hint, hint).
