This is very much a beta version, so please let me know if you spot any errors or have other features you'd like to see. I'll never do a true campaign manager for it, but little tools like the ones I created (i.e., encounter creation) are doable. On the front page of the application, I have a "release notes" button you can press to get more information. My code isn't the most efficient from a programming perspective because I'm relearning the art. However, structurally inefficient code sometimes makes for faster code (in a narrow set of instances), and because this game is structurally quite simple, that works here.
This is an MS Access database, which means two things. First, the tool is limited in a bunch of ways that affect even simple projects like this one. The user interface leaves something to be desired, though I think the chracter sheet somehow came out pretty well. Second, this won't work on Apple products without some workarounds I don't completely understand. You're on your own on that one.
I plan to replace this with a web-based product, but that's a little ways off.
I'm also in the process of creating a character builder for the FASA Star Trek RPG from the 1980s. It can currently create Federation and Romulan PCs, so I still need to add the capacity to create Klingon and Orion PCs. However, in 2012, I created an application that did everything else. It allows you to instantly create solar systems, NPCs of all races, starships MCPs, etc. You can find those materials here: https://gsllcblog.com/fasa-star-trek-rpg-resources/. All are free, though I do have a donation button somewhere on that blog (hint, hint).

EDIT 1/13/2026: Version 2. I added a very primitive, and thus clunky, initiative tracker to the GM Tools screen. I'll probably try to clean it up at a later date, but the way it works is as follows: On tab 1 of GM Tools, enter in all your PCs, which includes character and player names, hit points, initiative bonus, and initiative score (rolled or assigned). On tab 2, build your NPC encounter (as already exists) then click the Initiative button. Nothing will appear to happen, but when you go to the next tab, you'll see all PCs and NPCs in an initiative tracker. You can add conditions and modify their hit points, but you have to go back to the encounter builder to once again pull up an NPC's stat block. You can delay characters or break initiative ties by moving them up or down in order. You can track their hit points and conditions. Note: Data is persistent. If you close out the software, your encounter data will still be there when you get back. Warning: Hitting the Initiative button undoes your current initiative, rerolling your scores. Future plans: I plan to give you the ability to quickly pull up the definition of a condition and pull up stat blocks from the initiative page. I also plan to allow you to import existing characters rather than have to type them in. This is not a priority, as there's very little data that you currently need to enter, but allowing you to do so would give me the availability of data for the GM to open a PC stat block as well.

EDIT 1/15/2026: Version 3. I corrected a major omission on the character sheet (i.e., each power's type of attack, such as "close burst 2" or "area burst 1 within 10"), added a lot more data that one can enter when creating PCs, and built the behind-the-scenes structure that will allow me to allow a user to import a previously saved PC into initiative. I noticed that if a user tries to import a previously saved PC from a file format that isn't .csv, the error message received is, let's say, inelegant. I'll do a run through and try to clean up how the software interacts with the user. I'm prepping an adventure I'll be running soon, so these bugs will be rooted out sooner rather than later then dealt with accordingly. I've already found a few others and cleaned them up, but they aren't worth mentioning.

EDIT 1/16/2026: I loaded the application onto another computer and found an issue. When I open the character sheet (which must be done while the character generator data entry form is open), and try to print the character sheet using the print button in the Access ribbon, it instead prints the underlyng character generator data entry form. There are a few workarounds, but the easiest one is this: When printing the character sheet, right click directly on the report itself and choose "Print..." from the pop up menu that creates. This forces the system to print the character sheet instead of the data entry form. Also of note is that when you try to open the character, and the character's image file is not on your computer in the exact location it needs to be, then you'll get one of those "inelegant" errors I mentioned in my 1/15/2026, entry. Okay, that's fine, but that error stops the import process and prevents the gear from loading (and perhaps some other things). So, you really can't yet move your characters to other computers unless you don't use character image files. However, staying on one computer, you can still save and load characters, so this shouldn't be a critical issue for most.

EDIT 1/19/2026: Version 4. With my impending game coming up in a couple of weeks, I’ve been inspired to add new features and make some corrections. Of course, this can also lead to new bugs, but addressing errors is at least a small part of what I’ve implemented in this new version. These are the primary changes for Version 4.
1.	You can now add custom armor bonuses for when you salvage Omega Tech armor with nonstandard bonuses. For example, when you salvage a Dimensional Shuntshield, it becomes ordinary light armor but with a +4 armor bonus to AC (rather than +3) and a +1 armor bonus to Fortitude and Reflex (rather than +0 to both). You can now check off that your armor is custom armor and enter the +4 and +1 into appropriate text boxes. I imagine that a GM might grant a character natural armor (or other boons through genetic enhancement) outside the scope of anything provided in published material. This works with the new feature. Just select "no armor," check the Custom checkbox, and fill in all the custom values. If the character still wears armor, then just select that armor, fill in the regular numbers (e.g., +7 for heavy armor), but give it a custom bonus as apporpriate (e.g., a +1 to Reflex due to genetic enhancements).
2.	Character Sheet: Added what type of armor the character is using, adding “(s)” if they’re carrying a shield as well (e.g., “heavy(s)” v. “heavy”). There’s no indication that the armor is custom, but the numbers reflect custom bonuses to defenses and speed.
3.	Character Sheet: Added the overcharge bonus as a parenthetical to the primary ability.
4.	Character Builder: When clicking the Open Character button, I've now added cleaner error messages for the easily made mistake of opening the wrong file type (Access won't allow me to restrict what you see to just files with a given extension). More will likely be necessary as new errors are discovered, but there’s a catch all that at least gives a clean, if cryptic and unhelpful, error message.
5.	Character Builder: More instructions in red text to guide the process. I'll probably replace some of these red labels with "control tip" text. That is, instead of having the instructions on screen, relevant instructions will pop up when you hover your mouse over the relevant control for a second or so, and disappear when you move the mouse away.
6.	Behind the scenes, all the Alpha Mutation and Omega Tech cards I own are now entered into the database, which is only 100 of the total 200 that exist. (Note: Cryptic alliance cards are not entered yet. I forgot. I believe those will give me another 8, so I’ll have 108 of 200.) However, I don’t know exactly what to do with these cards. As I imagine it, deck building could be quite tedious using this software, so it might be far easier just to use physical cards. Still, I want to give people the option if I can find a way to make it work. It’s just not a priority to implement it yet. I’d rather clean up what’s clearly useable.
