This is very much a beta version, so please let me know if you spot any errors or have other features you'd like to see. I'll never do a true campaign manager for it, but little tools like the ones I created (i.e., encounter creation) are doable. On the front page of the application, I have a "release notes" button you can press to get more information. My code isn't the most efficient from a programming perspective because I'm relearning the art. However, structurally inefficient code sometimes makes for faster code (in a narrow set of instances), and because this game is structurally quite simple, that works here.
